 * <br>
 * 		object Service [read-only]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Object path of the GATT service the characteristic<br>
 * 			belongs to.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		array{byte} Value [read-only, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The cached value of the characteristic. This property<br>
 * 			gets updated only after a successful read request and<br>
 * 			when a notification or indication is received, upon<br>
 * 			which a PropertiesChanged signal will be emitted.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean WriteAcquired [read-only, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			True, if this characteristic has been acquired by any<br>
 * 			client using AcquireWrite.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			For client properties is ommited in case<br>
 * 			'write-without-response' flag is not set.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			For server the presence of this property indicates<br>
 * 			that AcquireWrite is supported.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean NotifyAcquired [read-only, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			True, if this characteristic has been acquired by any<br>
 * 			client using AcquireNotify.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			For client this properties is ommited in case 'notify'<br>
 * 			flag is not set.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			For server the presence of this property indicates<br>
 * 			that AcquireNotify is supported.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Notifying [read-only, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			True, if notifications or indications on this<br>
 * 			characteristic are currently enabled.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		array{string} Flags [read-only]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Defines how the characteristic value can be used. See<br>
 * 			Core spec "Table 3.5: Characteristic Properties bit<br>
 * 			field", and "Table 3.8: Characteristic Extended<br>
 * 			Properties bit field".<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The "x-notify" and "x-indicate" flags restrict access<br>
 * 			to notifications and indications by imposing write<br>
 * 			restrictions on a characteristic's client<br>
 * 			characteristic configuration descriptor.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Allowed values:<br>
 * <br>
 * 				"broadcast"<br>
 * 				"read"<br>
 * 				"write-without-response"<br>
 * 				"write"<br>
 * 				"notify"<br>
 * 				"indicate"<br>
 * 				"authenticated-signed-writes"<br>
 * 				"extended-properties"<br>

 * 				"secure-indicate" (Server only)<br>
 * 				"authorize"<br>
 * <br>
 * 		uint16 Handle [read-write, optional] (Server Only)<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Characteristic handle. When available in the server it<br>
 * 			would attempt to use to allocate into the database<br>
 * 			which may fail, to auto allocate the value 0x0000<br>
 * 			shall be used which will cause the allocated handle to<br>
 * 			be set once registered.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		uint16 MTU [read-only]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Characteristic MTU, this is valid both for ReadValue<br>
 * 			and WriteValue but either method can use long<br>
 * 			procedures when supported.<br>
