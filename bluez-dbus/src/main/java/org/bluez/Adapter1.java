 *             [variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Supported properties:</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Address [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth device address.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string AddressType [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth  Address Type. For dual-mode and BR/EDR<br>
 * 			only adapter this defaults to "public". Single mode LE<br>
 * 			adapters may have either value. With privacy enabled<br>
 * 			this contains type of Identity Address and not type of<br>
 * 			address used for connection.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Possible values:<br>
 * 				"public" - Public address<br>
 * 				"random" - Random address<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Name [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth system name (pretty hostname).<br>
 * <br>
 * 			This property is either a static system default<br>
 * 			or controlled by an external daemon providing<br>
 * 			access to the pretty hostname configuration.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Alias [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth friendly name. This value can be<br>
 * 			changed.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			In case no alias is set, it will return the system<br>
 * 			provided name. Setting an empty string as alias will<br>
 * 			convert it back to the system provided name.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			When resetting the alias with an empty string, the<br>
 * 			property will default back to system name.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			On a well configured system, this property never<br>
 * 			needs to be changed since it defaults to the system<br>
 * 			name and provides the pretty hostname. Only if the<br>
 * 			local name needs to be different from the pretty<br>
 * 			hostname, this property should be used as last<br>
 * 			resort.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		uint32 Class [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth class of device.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			This property represents the value that is either<br>
 * 			automatically configured by DMI/ACPI information<br>
 * 			or provided as static configuration.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Powered [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Switch an adapter on or off. This will also set the<br>
 * 			appropriate connectable state of the controller.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The value of this property is not persistent. After<br>
 * 			restart or unplugging of the adapter it will reset<br>
 * 			back to false.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string PowerState [readonly, experimental]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The power state of an adapter.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The power state will show whether the adapter is<br>
 * 			turning off, or turning on, as well as being on<br>
 * 			or off.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Possible values:<br>
 * 				"on" - powered on<br>
 * 				"off" - powered off<br>
 * 				"off-enabling" - transitioning from "off" to "on"<br>
 * 				"on-disabling" - transitioning from "on" to "off"<br>
 * 				"off-blocked" - blocked by rfkill<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Discoverable [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Switch an adapter to discoverable or non-discoverable<br>
 * 			to either make it visible or hide it. This is a global<br>
 * 			setting and should only be used by the settings<br>
 * 			application.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			If the DiscoverableTimeout is set to a non-zero<br>
 * 			value then the system will set this value back to<br>
 * 			false after the timer expired.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			In case the adapter is switched off, setting this<br>
 * 			value will fail.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			When changing the Powered property the new state of<br>
 * 			this property will be updated via a PropertiesChanged<br>
 * 			signal.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			For any new adapter this settings defaults to false.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Pairable [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Switch an adapter to pairable or non-pairable. This is<br>
 * 			a global setting and should only be used by the<br>
 * 			settings application.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Note that this property only affects incoming pairing<br>
 * 			requests.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			For any new adapter this settings defaults to true.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		uint32 PairableTimeout [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The pairable timeout in seconds. A value of zero<br>
 * 			means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in<br>
 * 			pairable mode forever.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The default value for pairable timeout should be<br>
 * 			disabled (value 0).<br>
 * <br>
 * 		uint32 DiscoverableTimeout [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The discoverable timeout in seconds. A value of zero<br>
 * 			means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in<br>
 * 			discoverable/limited mode forever.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The default value for the discoverable timeout should<br>
 * 			be 180 seconds (3 minutes).<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Discovering [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Indicates that a device discovery procedure is active.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		array{string} UUIDs [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available<br>
 * 			local services.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Modalias [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Local Device ID information in modalias format<br>
 * 			used by the kernel and udev.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		array{string} Roles [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			List of supported roles. Possible values:<br>
 * 				"central": Supports the central role.<br>
 * 				"peripheral": Supports the peripheral role.<br>
 * 				"central-peripheral": Supports both roles<br>
 * 						      concurrently.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		array{string} ExperimentalFeatures [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the experimental<br>
 * 			features currently enabled.<br>

     * int16 RSSI<br>
     * <br>
     * 	RSSI threshold value.<br>
     * <br>
     * 	PropertiesChanged signals will be emitted<br>
     * 	for already existing Device objects, with<br>
     * 	updated RSSI value. If one or more discovery<br>
     * 	filters have been set, the RSSI delta-threshold,<br>

     * 	will not be applied.<br>
     * <br>

     * 		"bredr"	- BR/EDR inquiry<br>
     * 		"le"	- LE scan only<br>

     * 	If "auto" transport is requested, scan will use<br>
     * 	LE, BREDR, or both, depending on what's<br>
     * 	currently enabled on the controller.<br>
     * <br>
     * bool DuplicateData (Default: true)<br>
