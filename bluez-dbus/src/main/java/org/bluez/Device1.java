 *             [variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Supported properties:</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Address [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth device address of the remote device.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string AddressType [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth device Address Type. For dual-mode and<br>
 * 			BR/EDR only devices this defaults to "public". Single<br>
 * 			mode LE devices may have either value. If remote device<br>
 * 			uses privacy than before pairing this represents address<br>
 * 			type used for connection and Identity Address after<br>
 * 			pairing.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Possible values:<br>
 * 				"public" - Public address<br>
 * 				"random" - Random address<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Name [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth remote name. This value can not be<br>
 * 			changed. Use the Alias property instead.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			This value is only present for completeness. It is<br>
 * 			better to always use the Alias property when<br>
 * 			displaying the devices name.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			If the Alias property is unset, it will reflect<br>
 * 			this value which makes it more convenient.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Icon [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Proposed icon name according to the freedesktop.org<br>
 * 			icon naming specification.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		uint32 Class [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Bluetooth class of device of the remote device.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		uint16 Appearance [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			External appearance of device, as found on GAP service.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		array{string} UUIDs [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available<br>
 * 			remote services.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Paired [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Indicates if the remote device is paired. Paired means<br>
 * 			the pairing process where devices exchange the<br>
 * 			information to establish an encrypted connection has<br>
 * 			been completed.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Bonded [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Indicates if the remote device is bonded. Bonded means<br>
 * 			the information exchanged on pairing process has been<br>
 * 			stored and will be persisted.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Connected [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Indicates if the remote device is currently connected.<br>
 * 			A PropertiesChanged signal indicate changes to this<br>
 * 			status.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Trusted [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Indicates if the remote is seen as trusted. This<br>
 * 			setting can be changed by the application.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean Blocked [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			If set to true any incoming connections from the<br>
 * 			device will be immediately rejected. Any device<br>
 * 			drivers will also be removed and no new ones will<br>
 * 			be probed as long as the device is blocked.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean WakeAllowed [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			If set to true this device will be allowed to wake the<br>
 * 			host from system suspend.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Alias [readwrite]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The name alias for the remote device. The alias can<br>
 * 			be used to have a different friendly name for the<br>
 * 			remote device.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			In case no alias is set, it will return the remote<br>
 * 			device name. Setting an empty string as alias will<br>
 * 			convert it back to the remote device name.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			When resetting the alias with an empty string, the<br>
 * 			property will default back to the remote name.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		object Adapter [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The object path of the adapter the device belongs to.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		boolean LegacyPairing [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Set to true if the device only supports the pre-2.1<br>
 * 			pairing mechanism. This property is useful during<br>
 * 			device discovery to anticipate whether legacy or<br>
 * 			simple pairing will occur if pairing is initiated.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Note that this property can exhibit false-positives<br>
 * 			in the case of Bluetooth 2.1 (or newer) devices that<br>
 * 			have disabled Extended Inquiry Response support.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		string Modalias [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Remote Device ID information in modalias format<br>
 * 			used by the kernel and udev.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		int16 RSSI [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Received Signal Strength Indicator of the remote<br>
 * 			device (inquiry or advertising).<br>
 * <br>
 * 		int16 TxPower [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Advertised transmitted power level (inquiry or<br>
 * 			advertising).<br>
 * <br>
 * 		dict ManufacturerData [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Manufacturer specific advertisement data. Keys are<br>
 * 			16 bits Manufacturer ID followed by its byte array<br>
 * 			value.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		dict ServiceData [readonly, optional]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Service advertisement data. Keys are the UUIDs in<br>
 * 			string format followed by its byte array value.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		bool ServicesResolved [readonly]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Indicate whether or not service discovery has been<br>
 * 			resolved.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		array{byte} AdvertisingFlags [readonly, experimental]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Advertising Data Flags of the remote device.<br>
 * <br>
 * 		dict AdvertisingData [readonly, experimental]<br>
 * <br>
 * 			The Advertising Data of the remote device. Keys are<br>
 * 			are 8 bits AD Type followed by data as byte array.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Note: Only types considered safe to be handled by<br>
 * 			application are exposed.<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Possible values:<br>
 * 				&lt;type&gt; &lt;byte array&gt;<br>
 * 				...<br>
 * <br>
 * 			Example:<br>
 * 				&lt;Transport Discovery&gt; &lt;Organization Flags...&gt;<br>
